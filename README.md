The password change system works very simply, as soon as the change form is opened, a unique code is sent to the specified e-mail of the administrator which needs to be confirmed. If you enter an incorrect code, the system throws the administrator out of the account to prevent hacking.

####__Logs__
After you click on the logs button, a window with the login history of the account opens, which has detailed information about the user's ip, time and date of login.
